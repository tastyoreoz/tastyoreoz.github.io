      <p>This is a website that I put together for fun. <br>I enjoy programming and making stuff (LOL, because the website is OrrStuff, I'm so clever).</p>
      <p>One of my goals for this website is to avoid inducing eyestrain in the visitors (you <3).</p>
      <p>I accomplish this by using darker colors. Even these letters are a light grey instead of white</p>
      <p>While I don't want the website to hurt your eyes, I am okay with the jokes making you hate me.</p>
